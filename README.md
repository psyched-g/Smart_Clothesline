# 🌧️ Sensor-Based Automated Rain Protection System for Clothesline  
### Dual-Microcontroller IoT-Enabled Smart Automation

This repository contains the complete implementation of a **sensor-based automated rain protection system for clotheslines** using a **dual-microcontroller architecture**.  
The system enables **automatic rain-triggered protection** as well as **manual remote control** through a mobile application.

The design is **universally adaptable** and can be installed on existing clothesline setups without structural modification.
